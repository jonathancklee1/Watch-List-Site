# Watch List Site
 
## About The Project
MyWatchList is a website that allows users to browse movies, tv shows and animes. It's main functionality is the ability to save the desired media item into a "to watch" list for later viewing. This idea had came from personal problem of mine where I often forget what I want to watch and I wanted to creatively build a platform that is funtionally and aesthetically better than simply using a note app to record the media title. Additionally, most media browsing sites are segregated to a single media type such as movies/tv shows/anime and with my interest in Japanese animations, I had blended the sources into one by utilising two different APIs to retrieve data. This project was created to solve this issue.  

Using APIs from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/), for movies and tv shows, and [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/), for animes, the data are fetched and displayed on the corresponding pages. By clicking on the item, more information are provided on a detail page such as release dates, producers, ratings and genres. An add to list button is displayed on the page that enables you to directly save to your list. The list page will have the basic "to do" list features like selecting and deleting items.

The project is built using front-end technologies only, so there is currently no cross-device list storing function in place as the lists are cached in local storage. This might be a future implemeentation for back-end incorporation that allows saving across different devices.
